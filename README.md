This project is implemented in Haskell and focuses on symbolic mathematical expression manipulation. The main goal is to create a derivative calculator that can compute the derivatives of mathematical expressions, such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, and powers, with respect to a variable. It defines a MathExpr data type for representing expressions and includes functions for evaluating, differentiating, and pretty-printing these expressions. This tool is designed to simplify symbolic differentiation, making it useful for mathematical modeling, symbolic computation, and educational purposes.
